## Popular Movies Stage 2: Trailers, Reviews, and Favorites

In this stage you’ll add additional functionality to the app you built in Stage 1.

You’ll add more information to your movie details view:
 - You’ll allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
 - You’ll allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
 - You’ll also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star). This is for a local movies collection that you will maintain and does not require an API request*.
 - You’ll modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.

Lastly, you’ll optimize your app experience for tablet.

## To Run:
- Open gradle.properties
- Update API_KEY with personal key from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.themoviedb.org/">The Movie DB</a> Api.
- Execute! :)
